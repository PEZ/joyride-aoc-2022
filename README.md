# Use VS Code and Joyride for Advent of Code 2022

[Joyride](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/joyride) is en extension that lets you script VS Code like Emacs can be scripted. Like with Emacs the scripting language is a LISP, making the programming fully interactive. The language is not ELisp, though, but [Clojure](https://clojure.org).

## How to Joyride AOC 2022 with VS Code

This is a template repository containing the following ingredients so that you can use VS Code and Clojure to solve [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems:

### What's included

* A scaffold script for solving the two parts of Day 1: []()
* A utility namespace for loading your AOC problem input for any (released) day
* Instructions to guide you

### Prerequisites

* Curiosity
* VS Code
* A copy of this repository opened in VS Code
* Node

### What you need to add

Two VS Code extensions:

* [Joyride](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.joyride) - The scripting environment, which includes Clojure and an nREPL server
* [Calva](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva) - A Clojure IDE, which includes an nREPL client

Don't worry if you don't have a clue what nREPL is, I won't even link to it here. What it means that you will have both a server and a client is that you don't need anything else to program in Clojure. (You might object that Node is needed in the list above, but it is only needed to install some npm modules that the utility script (somewhat unnecessarily) depends on.)

### Make your AOC browser extension avaliable to your scripts

To use the utility for downloading your AOC problems input, you will need to login to your AOC account and make that session available to the Joyride scripts. The utility script assumes a file named `.aoc-session` in the workspace root. This file should contain only the contents of the `session` cookie from the browser's session. A way to get at this cookie is:

1. Open the dev console when you are logged in at adventofcode.com
2. Open the Networks tab
3. Reload the page
4. Click the resource you have reloaded, (`1` if it was the Day 1 problem page)
5. Look for the cookies in the request headers.
6. Copy the content (right click -> copy)
7. Paste the contents into the file `.aoc-session`
8. Clean away everything except the content of the cookie named `session`. Everything. So `session=` and any `;` and newlines should be removed. (It is pretty easy to update the utility functions to do this cleaning for you, but it is not done yet.) You should have one line with only hex didgits in this file when you are done.)

### Open the Day one problem script

In VS Code that is.
